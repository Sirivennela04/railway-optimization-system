### Rate Limiting
- AI endpoints should implement rate limiting
- Suggested limits:
  - `/ai/analyze-situation`: 10 requests/minute per operator
  - `/ai/predict-critical-situations`: 5 requests/minute per system
  - `/ai/query`: 20 requests/minute per user

### Performance Considerations
- AI endpoints should respond within 5 seconds for real-time operations
- Implement async processing for complex analyses
- Cache frequent queries for improved performance
- Provide streaming responses for long-running predictions
